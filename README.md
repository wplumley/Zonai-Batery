Ethan is trying to create a code that will light up 8 LEDs on a breadboard. 

When  powered on all 8 LEDs will be turned on.
When the switch is switched to ON(HIGH) the LEDs will turn off one at a time until all LEDs are off.
When the switch is switched to off(LOW) the LEDSs will turn on one at a time until all LEDs are on.

He is trying to simulate a battery being charged when the switch is off and being drained when the switch is on.
